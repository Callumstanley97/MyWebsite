        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page :</h2>
    <div class="divquote">
        <p>The home page is a page purely about myself, an introduction about me. There are two pages for unit 1 and unit 2 which both contain my coursework. I have structured these pages in order of the questions from both units, with the answers underneath the questions. I have review pages for both unit 1 and unit 2 which contains my reviews for both of them, explaining how I feel about the project itself. Finally, I have a contact details page which contains my contact information if anybody would like to email me.</p>

        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites :</h2>
    <div class="divquote">
        <p>I made sure I didn’t mimic any other websites due to copyright and I didn’t use any logos or pictures which could be claimed against me. I think it's best to be original when it comes to designing as it allows you to implement your own styles and colour schemes. Having something made copyright helps keep content original as this only allows you to use it and nobody else. This way nobody can steal ideas from somewhere else.</p>

        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them :</h2>
    <div class="divquote">
        <p>Someone who is colour blind may have difficulty navigating my website because I haven’t implemented anything which could help. There are colour blind modes which help massively with this sort of problem. Someone may have visual impairment and to help with this you can add alt tags and this allows them to understand what they’re looking at. Describing your links is a good way of helping someone with a disability as it helps them understand it better.

        <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites :</h2>
    <div class="divquote">
        <p>There are several different file types for websites, CSS is one of the main file types I used for styling. CSS is very useful when it comes to designing as it helps you change the colour scheme of every page or a specific part of the page. Being able to use different fonts and colours help brighten up my website and it made it much nicer to look at. HTML is another appropriate file type for websites because it allows you to split your page up into different sections and helps you organise it alot better. You can also add headers and paragraphs into the page and divide.</p>
