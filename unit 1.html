            <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
<p>There are several purposes for technology in modern businesses. One of which is communication with customers, it is necessary for employees to interact with clients quickly and clearly. Websites allow customers to find answers to their questions outside of work hours, which is more efficient. 
    Another purpose is security, most businesses are vulnerable to security threats and vandalism. Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive decisions and other information that leads to competitive advantages. Last but not least, technology helps with efficiency of operations.
        Modern technology helps a business understand its cash flow and preserve precious resources. Warehouse inventory technologies help companies understand how best to manage the costs of holding products. Also, it helps the employees understand how much stock they have and if they need to order more.

    <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful?
        What tools? What skills? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>One approach I read up about was the Kanban approach, which meant that they had monthly operations reviews with all teams, a replenishment meeting involving mid-level management, standing meetings for each team, enhanced collaboration, risk reviews with the management office and several other planning and review meetings.
            A few skills which are vital are things such as copywriting & editing, problem solving, social media and negotiation skills. Good communication between the targeted audience and between the teams itself is vital. 
            With the correct resources, completing a digital project can move in the right direction a lot quicker and more efficiently. Some of the resources needed are things such as, having the correct software for whatever the project is, having an efficient and hard-working team which knows the direction of the project. Having a good budget will allow any project to expand its needs as far as needed
            </p>
            </div>
                <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <a class="trello

            <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects to fail? Why? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>There are a lot of risks when it comes to being successful in digital projects. Some of the main risks are cost risks, typically escalation of the project costs, schedule risks and performance risks. If a project takes longer than planned it could cause a number of problems such as increasing costs and delay project benefits. If the team you’re working with isn’t putting in 100% effort, then it’s very likely that the project is going to move a lot slower.
            Another risk projects take could be your company merging with another company which has a very different market strategy. There is also a possibility that other companies may release something very similar to what you’re working on and it may draw customers away from your project. 
            Having too many stakeholders can cause the project to become muddied due to too many committee decisions. A project needs creative direction and whoever influences this should make the direction of the project clear to everyone from the start.
            </p>
            </div>
                <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software - how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>First, you would have to make sure your processes are streamlined and documented before selecting what tool to use. Second, you would have to do some research in order to make sure you’re making a good decision. Speak to peer groups and see what others in your industry are doing. Third would be to get the correct advice, speaking to an expert is crucial. This could vary between speaking to the companies who provide the software and seeking the advice of your IT support partner. Fourth would be to invest in your business, for example choosing the cheaper software may save you money but in the long term it is important to choose the more appropriate tool. Finally, in order to get the optimum tool, it may be necessary to customise an existing tool that fits your specific needs.</p>

                <h2>1.6 How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code's version control? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>Trello has helped massively with my outcome because it allows me to create notes for ideas and instructions for the project. This helps me keep track of what I’m doing and it also allows me to choose which step I need to do next. I can put the notes in order of importance by changing the colour. 
                    GitHub is used more in a team environment whereas Trello is best used for an individual.

                <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>GDPR has permanently changed the way a business collects, stores and uses customer data. GDPR stands for “General Data Protection Regulation”. It applies to all companies selling to and storing personal data about customers in Europe. GDPR ensures that information is being securely protected across Europe. Personal data is any information related to a person such as a name or a photo.
            GDPR has caused the customer to be in control and the task of complying comes down to businesses and organizations. All companies that work with personal data have to appoint a data protection officer who is in charge of GDPR compliance.

                <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>I was happy using Visual Code Studio because it is really easy to use. When writing code it gives you hints for variables, functions, loops and so on. This allows you to write code a lot quicker and it also eliminates spelling mistakes, it almost writes the code for you. Having software that is easy to use allowed me to complete the project quicker and 
                more accurately. Also, when i used the wrong syntax, brackets or wrote the incorrect variable, visual studio told me there was an error and highlighted where I’d gone wrong.
                Codepen was a very good base to start from. I had to write the code myself and it helped me understand where I was going wrong. It didn’t give anything away and it showed me how I can change variables and add different functions into a piece of code.
                Trello was very beneficial as it lets you plan out every step of the project in the order which you think is appropriate. It was very easy to work with because it has a simple drag & drop system which lets you move any piece of information to the place you desire. This made planning very easy.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate. E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>Visual Studio was definitely appropriate for my project as it highlights any errors I make and this allowed me to change my code straight away if it was wrong. Having this system made the project move a lot faster than it would if I had used codepen. Codepen is very similar to visual studio, except if you make any errors in your code, it wouldn’t let you know and you would have to sieve through code for any spelling or grammar mistakes, and this can take a long time.
                Trello is nothing like visual studio or codepen. Trello is something you would use to plan your project as it lets you add lists and you can prioritise what you need to do first. Having something which lets you plan your project is a massive help as it lets you think in more depth because all of your thoughts are noted right in front of you. Another advantage of this is it slims the chances of forgetting to do something.

            </div>
                <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project - are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>The strengths of my project are definitely the fact that I have learnt so many skills in such a small amount of time. For example before i started this course I didn’t have the smallest clue how a website is created and designed. I wrote code for several different style types such as changing the font of my writing or the colour of the background. I can even add a picture to the background and it could be anything I like. I have added links to other pages on the website so you can easily access other pages. 
                The weaknesses in my opinion are, I feel I can add a lot more interactive stuff on the pages like buttons and borders. I know that at some point I will learn how to progress it more. I feel that the pages look a little bland and I could be more creative with them.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>There are plenty of further improvements that can be made to my project. I can be more creative, but in order to do that I’d need to learn more about how to change the design and learn new commands. The pages look a little dead and they can definitely be more fleshed out. I could add more sections to my website splitting it up more so it looks more organised for each question. I could add something to help people with disabilities so it’s easier for them to understand what's happening on the page such as alt tags.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>I have reviewed a few outcomes and made sure they match requirements. One I reviewed was, 2.2 describe whether the tools I used were appropriate. I read through and feel that I have met the requirements for this because I have gone into a lot of detail as to why some of the tools were useful and why. Another I reviewed was, 2.1 Am I happy with the tools I used. I described why I was happy with using specific tools and the benefits of using them.</p>
            </div>
                <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>The benefits of IT tools and systems are that they are so easy to use. They have things like intellisense which give you suggestions on what you need to write and where. It gives you a good idea about what you should be writing in your code. This helped me work a lot faster and more accurately.
                I definitely could have been more efficient in the sense that I should know how to write the code naturally, but as I’m still learning I had to do research which killed a lot of time.
                I could work in teams for sure. This would allow people to brainstorm ideas for designs and structures of the project. There are so many different ways of writing code and having other people throwing ideas out is a good way of figuring out the best way.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>I believe there are many ways I could improve productivity and efficiency.  Knowing how to write code naturally for starters would have helped me work twice as fast as it influenced me to look online for methods of what to write. Having more experience in all three softwares is crucial for efficiency. Using trello more could help me be more organised by eliminating steps one at a time.</p>
            </div>
                <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>Next time I would like to work in a team. This would allow a few people to throw different ideas for creativity and structure of the project. Others may plan it differently and that way could be more effective. Being more technically gifted could have helped me be more productive because it would allow me to use different aspects of designing</p>
            </div>
                <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solution :</h2>
            <div class="divquote">
                <p>I would start testing on different web browsers to see if different browsers work differently. Some functions may not work on different browsers. Another way could be trying it on a mobile or a tablet. Multiple session logins will help. Execute a bug hunt & regression test cycles, this is where you run through a number of journeys across available devices.<a class="reference
